# CM needs to access CAPI kubeconfig secrets from all project namespaces which contain Edge Cluster CAPI resources
# The namespaces are created by CM at runtime, hence we would need to also configure permissions to access secrets at this specific namespaces at runtime.
# This is not trivial, hence for our initial implementation we chosen the simplest method and we give access to all the secrets via ClusterRole.
#
# This issue is tracked in our issue tracker and will be addressed eventually. We are silencing it as known and accepted issue for now until it gets properly resolved.
